Code for 9/14 Workshop

All code is 3.x compatible, but not 2.x compatible<br/>
Make sure you have BeautifulSoup and the requests library installed using:<br/>
pip install beautifulsoup4<br/>
pip install requests<p/>
Note: If you have Python 3 installed alongside Python 2, you may have to use "pip3" instead of "pip", or run<br/>
apt-get install python3-pip<br/>
to get pip3
